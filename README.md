- The intergrated Modoru will downgrade your system to firmware 3.65 and attempt to auto install Enso

- The Enso app is also intergrated to manually Install or remove the Enso exploit on 3.60 and 3.65

- The app will auto detect if your using a Vita or PSTV then installs a starter plugin pack acordingly when you downgrade. For example the Vita pack includes the DS4 support plugin where as the PSTV pack installs DolcePolce (game whitelister)

- The PSM Mobile Runtime 2.01 is also installed during the downgrade or plugin installation

- The Storage format tool by SKGleba is included to corectly format your SD card for use in the SD2Vita or PSVSD adaptors

- Also include is my own UX0 to SD clone tool which will prepare your system to take an SD and then clone your current setup onto a genuine SD card

- There is a section where you are able to manually change the memory allocations (similar to using Autoplugin)

- There is an information page which shoes the current setup, the space used and will also check the validity of the SD card for potential fakes

- and finally there is also a homebrew app downloader and installer which has a selection of useful tools
