The Vita Companion is an all in one solution that will help make setting up your Vita a lot more efficient..

- Intergrated Modoru to downgrade your system to 3.65
- Attempts to automatically install the Enso exploit with the downgrade
- A starter plugin pack that auto install when you downgrade
- Storage format tool by SKGleba to corectly format your SD card
- My own UX0 to SD clone tool to cloning your system onto a genuine SD card (SD2VITA)
- Change memory allocations, similar to using Autoplugin
- Check the validity of the SD card for potential fakes
- Homebrew App download and Installer
