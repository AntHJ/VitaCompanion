- The intergrated Modoru will downgrade your system to firmware 3.65 and attempt to auto install Enso

- The Enso app is also intergrated to manually Intall or remove the Enso exploit on 3.60 and 3.65

- Auto detection of Vita or PSTV then installs a starter plugin pack automatically when you downgrade

- The Storage format tool by SKGleba is included to corectly format your SD card

- My own UX0 to SD clone tool to cloning your system onto a genuine SD card (SD2VITA)

- You are able to change memory allocations, similar to using Autoplugin

- You can check the validity of the SD card for potential fakes

- and finally there is also a homebrew app downloader and installer
